# VDD Core

VDD Core is a minimal Clojure library built to help enable Visualization Driven Development (VDD). Read [What is Visualization Driven Development](https://github.com/jasongilman/vdd-core/wiki/What-is-Visualization-Driven-Development%3F) first if you don't know what VDD is. VDD Core captures code execution as data in your coding environment, sends them to the browser, and then invokes code to visualize it. VDD Core is not a visualization framework or a replacement for things like D3 or Raphael.js. It will be a place to include components to make building visualizations of code execution easier.

## Examples

The [vdd-core-examples](https://github.com/Element84/vdd-core-examples) (TODO make sure this link works) project has several examples of using vdd-core. 

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

    [vdd-core "0.1.0"]

## Using VDD Core

See [Using VDD Core](https://github.com/jasongilman/vdd-core/wiki/Using-VDD-Core)

## Development

TODO how do you develop with it

  * How do you run tests?
  * How do you integration test it?
    * manually for now
    * Could we build a set of integration tests that run from within the brower? 

Pull requests and issues are accepted and appreciated.

### Future

TODO What are new ideas and places it could go in the future? Would this work better as a set of github issues?
