# VDD Core

VDD Core is a minimal Clojure library built to help enable Visualization Driven Development (VDD). Read [What is Visualization Driven Development](https://github.com/jasongilman/vdd-core/wiki/What-is-Visualization-Driven-Development%3F) first if you don't know what VDD is. VDD Core captures code execution as data in your coding environment, sends them to the browser, and then invokes code to visualize it. VDD Core is not a visualization framework or a replacement for things like D3 or Raphael.js. It will be a place to include components to make building visualizations of code execution easier.

## Examples

The [vdd-core-examples](https://github.com/Element84/vdd-core-examples) (TODO make sure this link works) project has several examples of using vdd-core.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

    [vdd-core "0.1.0"]

## Using VDD Core
