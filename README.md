# vdd-core

vdd-core is a minimal Clojure library built to help enable Visualization Driven Development (VDD). Read [What is Visualization Driven Development]() (TODO make a link) first if you don't know what VDD is. vdd-core captures code execution as data in your coding environment, sends them to the browser, and then invokes code to visualize it. vdd-core is not visualization framework or a replacement for things like D3 or Raphael.js. It will be a place to include components to make building visualizations of code execution easier.

## Examples

The [vdd-core-examples](https://github.com/Element84/vdd-core-examples) (TODO make sur ethis link works) project has several examples of using vdd-core. 

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

    [vdd-core "0.1.0"]

For more instructions see (TODO link to using vdd core)    

## Some sort of detailed description

TODO outline?


## Development

TODO how do you develop with it

  * How do you run tests?
  * How do you integration test it?
    * manually for now
    * Could we build a set of integration tests that run from within the brower? 

Pull requests and issues are accepted and appreciated.

### Future

TODO What are new ideas and places it could go in the future? Would this work better as a set of github issues?
