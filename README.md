# VDD Core

VDD Core is a minimal Clojure library built to help enable Visualization Driven Development (VDD). Read [What is Visualization Driven Development](https://github.com/Element84/vdd-core/wiki/What-is-Visualization-Driven-Development%3F) first if you don't know what VDD is. VDD Core captures code execution as data in your coding environment, sends them to the browser, and then invokes code to visualize it. VDD Core is not a visualization framework or a replacement for things like D3 or Raphael.js. It will be a place to include components to make building visualizations of code execution easier.

VDD Core is very new and is considered alpha quality

## Examples

The [vdd-core-examples](https://github.com/Element84/vdd-core-examples) project has several examples of using vdd-core.

## Installation

Add the following dependency to your `project.clj` file:

    [element84/vdd-core "0.1.0"]

## Using VDD Core

See [Using VDD Core](https://github.com/Element84/vdd-core/wiki/Using-VDD-Core) and documentation on the [wiki](https://github.com/Element84/vdd-core/wiki).

## TODO

These are areas in which VDD Core could be approved.

  * Visualization generator - A generator would make it easier to get started with a new visualization.
  * Built in visualizations - There are visualizations that would be useful for general Clojure development.
    * A data inspector similar to [clojure.inspector](http://tech.puredanger.com/2010/02/10/clojure-inspector/) is one example.

Contributions and pull requests are welcome.
