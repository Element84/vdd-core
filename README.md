# vdd-core

vdd-core is a minimal Clojure library built to help enable Visualization Driven Development (VDD). Read [What is Visualization Driven Development]() (TODO make a link) first if you don't know what VDD is. vdd-core captures code execution as data in your coding environment, sends them to the browser, and then invokes code to visualize it.

## What isn't it?

  * It's not a visualization framework or a replacement for things like D3 or Raphael.js. 
  * It's not _only_ an educational tool. It's useful for education as a bonus. It was built to be used to help develop production software.

## What is it?

  * a way to capture code execution and send it to the browser
  * a set of components to help aid in building visualizations of code execution.

What's the goal? 
What is the job of the project?
What doesn't it do

Should I have something describing what visualization driven development is?

TODO Link to example project

## Requirements

TODO

## Installation

TODO

## Some sort of detailed description

TODO outline?


## Development

TODO how do you develop with it

  * How do you run tests?
  * How do you integration test it?
    * manually for now
    * Could we build a set of integration tests that run from within the brower? 

### Future

TODO What are new ideas and places it could go in the future? Would this work better as a set of github issues?
